# Low-speed-wind-tunnel-airfoil-testing

## Overview
This project combines CAD design and Arduino to develop a low-cost wind tunnel with a functional instrumentation system to measure and compare the coeffecient of lift of an airfoil at different angles of attacks. 

## Objective
- Design and assemble a low-cost wind tunnel that allows for easy mounting of airfoils at different angles of attack.
- Apply aerodynamic analysis through measuring lift and windspeed to allow for calculation of coeffiecient of lift.
- Compare expiremental results with publish results and improve accuracy of wind-tunnel instrumentation system. 



## Methodology
- Formulated and assembled a wind tunnel through CAD designs, minimal 3-d printing, and low-cost materials. 
- Designed an airfoil mount to allow for a single airfoil to be mounted easily at different angle of attacks within the test section of wind tunnel, and be switched out for other airfoils.
- Implemented an Arduino instrumentation system to experimentally measure lift force with a HX711 load cell, and measure wind speed using a MPXV7002DP differential pressure sensor.
- Utilized 4-digit NACA airfoil MATLAB function to 3-D print NACA airfoils for testing with alterations to allow for mounting.
- Calculated coeffiecient of lift using lift and wind speed measurements of multiple airfoils at different angles of attacks.
- Compared coeffiecient of lift and angle of attack curves with official NACA airfoil data.
